"""Verifies the conftest.py autouse safety fixture is actually in effect.

These tests are NOT in test_ollama_install_flow.py, so the autouse fixture
should stub out the system-effect helpers. We assert the stubs are present
by checking that calling them through the modules where they're used
(autodidact.cli) returns the stubbed values, not what the real
implementations would do.

Background: an early version of the install-on-init flow ran the real Ollama
installer on a developer's machine. The autouse fixture in conftest.py
blocks that. These tests are a regression guard.

Note: ``from autodidact.setup_wizard import install_ollama`` would bind the
*real* function at import time and bypass the monkeypatch. We test through
``autodidact.cli`` (the consumer) since that's the path the wizard actually
takes at runtime.

"""Tests for the refusal detector routing override.

Context: logprob-based confidence scoring has a known failure mode — the local
model emits a hedge ("I don't have real-time data", "Did you mean X?") with
highly confident tokens, so routing sees ~0.9 confidence and returns the
non-answer. This detector catches voluntary surrender signals and forces a
cloud escalation regardless of confidence.

See CONTEXT.md for the routing invariants being preserved here.

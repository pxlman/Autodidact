# Autodidact

**A self-evolving AI agent that learns like a new employee.**

Autodidact is an AI agent with a local brain that works like a human, or a new employee. When asked a question or given a task, it thinks first and evaluates whether it can handle the task or answer the question by itself (local brain). If yes, it executes. If not, it escalates - by searching Google or asking a more powerful cloud model - just like how humans work. After the escalation, it learns the new knowledge, skills, or tool usages so next time it won't have to ask similar questions again.

On day one, it asks a lot of questions. By week two, it handles most tasks independently. By month three, it's the expert. Every cloud escalation becomes permanent local knowledge. Every interaction makes it smarter. It never forgets what it learned.

```
Query → Think  (check memory)
      → Try    (local model answers if confident)
      → Ask    (escalate to cloud when uncertain)
      → Learn  (store the answer for next time)
      ──────────────────────────────────────────
      Next similar query → Answer from memory, $0.00
```

## Four-command quickstart

```bash
pip install autodidact             # or: pip install "autodidact[openai,bedrock,pdf]"
autodidact init                    # zero-friction setup: auto-detects Ollama, pulls models, configures cloud
autodidact learn <path>            # A brand-new agent has an empty brain. `autodidact learn` seeds it with existing knowledge. <Path> points to the folder having documents or code you want the agent to learn.
autodidact chat                    # start talking to the agent
```

That's it. `autodidact init` walks you through five setup modes:

1. **Local + Cloud** (default) — Ollama local model + cloud API for escalation. Best cost savings.
2. **Cloud + Cloud** — cheap cloud model + expensive cloud model. No GPU or Ollama required.
3. **Local + Local** — small Ollama + big Ollama. Fully offline, still learns from escalations. Free.
4. **Custom local** — any OpenAI-compatible server (llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, LocalAI) + optional cloud.
5. **Local only** — single Ollama model. Free. No escalation learning.

If Ollama isn't installed, the wizard offers to install it (with retry on failure). If your model isn't pulled, it pulls it automatically. If Ollama isn't running, it starts the daemon for you. On corporate networks where Ollama can't be installed, mode 2 or 4 work without it.

## How it works - the human analogy

When you encounter a question, you go through this sequence:

1. **Do I know the answer?** → Check your memory
2. **Am I confident I can answer it?** → Self-assess
3. **If yes** → Answer (free, fast)
4. **If no** → Ask someone smarter (costs time, but you get the right answer)
5. **Remember what you learned** → Store it
6. **Next time, start from step 1** → You're smarter now

A new employee does this every day. The more tasks they do, the more knowledgeable they become, the fewer questions they ask. Eventually, they're the person others come to.

**Autodidact makes AI work the same way.**

### The visible thought process

Every response shows the agent's reasoning, in real time:

```
You> What's our PTO policy?
[THINKING] Checking memory... no relevant entries yet (0 hits)
[CLOUD] Escalated — gpt-4o-mini took 1.2s
[LEARNED] ✅ Stored: "Company PTO is 20 days per year, accrued monthly."
  💰 $0.003 | Confidence: 0.34 → escalated | ✅ Learned

You> How much vacation do I get?
[THINKING] Checking memory... found 1 similar entry (similarity: 0.91)
[MEMORY] Company PTO is 20 days per year, accrued monthly.
  ↳ Recalled from: "What's our PTO policy?" (learned 0 days ago)
  💰 $0.00 | Confidence: 0.91 | Route: memory
```

That's the "magic moment" - the user watching the agent answer from learned knowledge, for free, because it remembered a question it was asked moments ago.

## Solving the cold start

A brand-new agent has an empty brain. `autodidact learn` seeds it with existing knowledge:

```bash
autodidact learn ~/docs/policies/     # ingest a folder of docs
autodidact learn ./README.md          # ingest a single file
autodidact learn --stats              # show what's been ingested
```

Supports `.md`, `.txt`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.html`, and 15+ other text formats. PDFs via `pip install "autodidact[pdf]"`. Chunks are stored separately from learned Q&A (one is reference material, the other is experience), but both get retrieved and injected into the prompt at query time.

## What's in v1.0.x

- **Zero-friction setup wizard.** Auto-detects Ollama, pulls models, starts daemon, retries on failure. Presets for 10 cloud providers.
- **Five setup modes.** Local+Cloud, Cloud+Cloud, Local+Local, Custom server, Local-only. Works everywhere — GPU, no GPU, corporate network, offline.
- **Hybrid retrieval.** BM25 keyword search (FTS5) + vector similarity (FAISS), merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Finds documents by exact terms AND meaning.
- **Document synthesis.** `autodidact learn` doesn't just index — it extracts key facts into memory (background, non-blocking). The agent answers from internalized knowledge, not raw chunks.
- **Confidence-based routing.** GSA pre-screen + logprob uncertainty + refusal detection. Escalates when uncertain, stays local when confident.
- **Learning from escalations.** Structured knowledge extraction from cloud responses (background, non-blocking). Deduplication on insert.
- **Visible learning UX.** `[THINKING]`, `[MEMORY]`, `[LOCAL]`, `[CLOUD]`, `[LEARNED]` tags show what the agent is doing and why.
- **Cost tracking.** `autodidact savings` reports cumulative cost avoided vs an all-cloud baseline.
- **Local-first.** All state in one portable SQLite file (`~/.autodidact/memory.db`). Works offline after setup.
- **Multi-provider.** Ollama, any OpenAI-compatible server (llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM), AWS Bedrock. 10 cloud provider presets.

## Commands

```

## What's NOT in v1.0.x (coming in v1.5 and v2.0)

- No topic-based knowledge pages (v1.5 — knowledge compiled into pages, not flat facts)
- No tool execution (v2.0 — terminal, file ops, ReAct loop)
- No skill learning from tasks (v2.0 — learns procedures, not just facts)
- No reranking (v2.0 — cross-encoder on retrieval candidates)
- No MCP server (v2.0)
- No OpenAI-compatible proxy mode (v1.5 — `autodidact serve`)

All of these are designed and planned. See [`docs/DESIGN-V2.md`](docs/DESIGN-V2.md) for architecture.

## What we **have** verified empirically:

- `logprob_uncertainty` is the dominant routing signal (AUROC 0.65-0.83 across 3 model families × 2 datasets).
- Zero-shot inference-time signals match supervised routing baselines (RouteLLM) at zero per-model training cost.
- Naive multi-signal fusion hurts - the best single signal beats the mean of all 6 signals.
- Signal quality correlates with RLHF calibration training across model families (Qwen > Llama).

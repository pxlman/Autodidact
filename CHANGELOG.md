## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-13

Polish, performance, and correctness on top of 1.0.0. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **Streaming chat** for both local and cloud paths — tokens render as they
  arrive instead of waiting for the full response. Spinner disappears once
  the first token lands. Anthropic extended-thinking content streams under
  a `[THINKING]` header. (#18)
- **`/learn <path>` chat slash command** — ingest documents from inside
  a chat session without leaving the REPL. Bypasses LLM routing and calls
  `DocumentStore.ingest()` directly. Supports `/learn .`, `/learn ~/x`, and
  paths with whitespace. (#22)
- **Live Bedrock model discovery** — `autodidact init` now queries
  `list_foundation_models` + `list_inference_profiles` against the user's
  region and presents only models they can actually invoke. Replaces the
  static preset, which shipped invented IDs and IDs unavailable in some
  regions. (#24)
- **Live OpenRouter catalog browse** — picker gets a "Browse all OpenRouter
  models" entry that hits `/v1/models`, sorts cheapest first, and shows
  per-1M-token pricing alongside each ID. 364+ models available without
  leaving the wizard. (#24)
- **Wizard installs Ollama and starts the daemon when missing** —
  `autodidact init` offers to run the official curl installer on macOS
  and Linux, and to start the daemon if it is down. macOS Gatekeeper and
  Login Items hint included on permission errors. (#16)
- **Smaller default local models** — recommendations shifted down one tier
  per hardware bucket. 32GB Apple Silicon now defaults to `qwen3:8b` instead
  of `qwen3:14b`; the minimal tier stays at `qwen3:0.6b`. (#21)

### Changed

- **GSA forces `think=false`** to keep the YES/NO probe calibrated; reasoning
  tokens were dragging probabilities toward the middle. The chat path keeps
  thinking enabled by default. (#17)
- **Default LLM client timeout** raised from 60s to 300s — large local
  models can take longer than 60s on first-token cold-start. (#17)
- **Retry policy split** by exception class — `ConnectionError` and
  `ConnectTimeout` retry with exponential backoff; `ReadTimeout` fails
  fast. Hung requests no longer multiply latency. (#17)
- **Logprob requests dropped from the chat path** — adds ~150ms per Ollama
  call and the post-local logprob gate is no longer used for routing. GSA
  pre-gate plus the refusal detector cover the same need without the cost.
  (#20)
- **Bedrock model preset is now empty** — discovery is the source of truth.
  Falls back to free-form input on any discovery failure. (#24)

### Fixed

- **GSA error message no longer hides Bedrock errors.** A wide `try/except`
  in `Agent.query()` was wrapping both the GSA probe and the cloud
  escalation. A `ValidationException` from Bedrock surfaced as
  "GSA probe failed, skipping gate: ..." while local silently produced an
  answer. The `try` is now scoped to the probe only; cloud errors
  propagate. (#24)
- **Logprob check no longer triggers false escalations on thinking
  responses.** Thinking-token logprobs were averaged in with content,
  dragging the local confidence below threshold. Routing now skips the
  logprob signal when the response includes thinking tokens. (#19)
- **Document chunks no longer overflow BGE-large's 512-token context.**
  Default chunk size lowered to 384 tokens with a hard cap at 480. Live
  `/learn .` no longer fails with "input length exceeds context length"
  on code files. (#23)
- **Ollama model verification rewritten to use `/api/show`.** Catches the
  cloud-only manifest case — some Ollama tags pull a tiny manifest that
  points at remote inference; the old `ollama list` parse couldn't tell
  these apart from real local models. (#16)
- **Wizard tests can no longer install Ollama on the host.** A conftest
  fixture now blocks real installer invocation in tests, regression-guarding
  an earlier accident. (#16)
- **Embedding model namespace fix** — pulled the right tag for
  `qllama/bge-large-en-v1.5`. (#7)


## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-09

The first shippable release. A self-evolving AI agent with a local brain,
confidence-based routing, and learning from cloud escalations.

### Added

- **Agent core** — `Agent.query()` with three-stage routing (memory → local → cloud),
  `Agent.correct()` for user corrections, `Agent.savings()` for cost tracking.
- **Zero-friction setup wizard** (`autodidact init`) — auto-detects Ollama,
  auto-pulls missing models, cloud provider presets for OpenAI, OpenRouter,
  DeepSeek, and Bedrock. Three setup modes: local+cloud, cloud+cloud, local-only.
- **Cloud-to-cloud routing** — the "local" slot can hold a cheap cloud model
  (gpt-4o-mini, DeepSeek, etc.) that escalates to an expensive cloud model.
  No Ollama or GPU required.
- **Document ingestion** (`autodidact learn <path>`) — cold-start fix. Chunks
  and embeds text files (.md, .txt, .py, .ts, .json, .yaml, + 15 others),
  respects `.gitignore`, deduplicates on re-ingestion. PDF support via the
  optional `[pdf]` extra.
- **Visible learning UX** — `[THINKING]`, `[MEMORY]`, `[LOCAL]`, `[CLOUD]`,
  `[LEARNED]` tags rendered with rich; real-time `on_progress` callback
  hook for custom UIs.
- **Learning extractor** — structured knowledge extraction from cloud responses
  via the local LLM, with a raw-answer fallback when JSON parsing fails.
- **Knowledge store** — SQLite + FAISS, STM/LTM tiers, Ebbinghaus decay,
  deduplication, scoped search by domain/topic/category.
- **Confidence evaluator** — 5-signal Thompson Sampling fusion. `logprob_uncertainty`
  is the dominant signal (validated AUROC 0.65-0.83 across 3 model families × 2
  datasets).
- **Grounded self-assessment (GSA v3)** — retrieval-conditional pre-response
  confidence signal with 3-tier extraction fallback.
- **CLI** — `init`, `chat`, `query`, `learn`, `savings`, `memory stats`,
  `memory search`.
- **Multi-provider LLM client** — Ollama (local), OpenAI-compatible
  (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Together, etc.), AWS Bedrock via optional
  `[bedrock]` extra. Retry logic with exponential backoff, throttle handling.

### Fixed

- Stale memory entries now fall through to local generation instead of
  escalating straight to cloud. Escalation only happens when local confidence
  is also low — matching the original routing intent (escalate when uncertain,
  not when memory is merely old).
- Packaging bug: `dependencies = [...]` was mis-nested under `[project.urls]`,
  causing `pip install autodidact` to install with zero runtime dependencies.
  Moved inside `[project]` and added a regression guard test.

### Notes

- Research findings (zero-shot confidence signals vs supervised routing) have
  their own home at [zero-shot-llm-confidence](https://github.com/paulnnguyen/zero-shot-llm-confidence).
- Algorithms are not individually novel; the contribution is the well-engineered
  closed loop and the end-to-end measurement with answer accuracy preserved.
